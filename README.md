# iOSudoku
### Project Description
Our group wanted to make a game on iOS; our app will allow the user to play Sudoku on a 3x3, 6x6, or 9x9 board, in a classic (timed) or zen (untimed) mode. The classic 9x9 board can be played in beginner, medium, or expert levels, and if we have time, we would also like to implement “greater than sudoku”, which is sudoku with extra constraints on each of the edges dictating inequalities between adjacent boxes.
On the backend, we will implement code than can, given number of rows/columns and a level of difficulty, generate a game of sudoku and its solution. We will have a “hint” button which will reveal a random box from the solution that is not already filled into the game. This game will involve things we have learned already (views, segues, and table views) and will also require a fair amount of self-learning and trial-and-error (how to generate a game of sudoku with one unique solution, drawing a “greater than sudoku” game, etc.). On the frontend, we hope to come up with a visually pleasing color scheme and game renderings that make our game as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind.
